1.  Fukuoka Tower - because who doesn't love a good tower with a gift shop?
2.  Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine - a famous Shinto shrine with a beautiful garden, but don't worry, it's not too spiritual for your taste.
3.  Fukuoka's LaLaport shopping mall - features a life-sized RX-93ff Nu Gundam statue, the largest Gundam statue in Japan, standing at 24.8 meters tall. 
4.  Fukuoka Asian Art Museum - where you can appreciate the finer things in life, like ancient ceramics and whatnot.
5.  Canal City Hakata - This full-scale commercial complex opened in 1996 under the concept of being an urban theater. Centered around the canal that runs north to south, 
Canal City features hotels, theaters, shops, restaurants, specialty stores, and showrooms. In addition to the daily fountain show and event venue, 
there’s also a cinema complex, making this a popular date spot for local Hakata residents.

7.  Ohori Park - another lovely park with a beautiful lake and plenty of opportunities for you to Instagram your boredom.
9.  Sasebo Harbor - where you can take in the sights and sounds of the sea, but only if you're into that sorta thing.
