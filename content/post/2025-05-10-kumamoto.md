10-12 May 2025 Super Hotel Kumamoto
üé´ Kyushu JR Pass

üèÉ‚Äç From Beppu, take the JR Kagoshima Main Line train towards Fukuoka. 
Get off at the Kumamoto Station, and then just... well, just follow the crowds to the park. 
I am sure it will be a real challenge to navigate. üèÉ‚Äç

üèÉ‚Äç There is an optional route to take to go to Kagoshima Chouo then back to Hakata on 12th May using Shinkansen.
Notable things to do there are:
1. Explore the Kagoshima Castle, which was built on top of an old samurai tomb, because what is more interesting than a bunch of old bones?
2. Take a stroll through the Sengan-en Garden, a beautiful park with lovely views and a lovely history that I'm sure you'll find absolutely riveting.
3. Go shopping at the Kagoshima Central Market, where you can buy all sorts of fresh seafood and local delicacies to make your taste buds weep with joy (said no one ever).
